# GoogleMap_FindingNearbyLocation-with-Routing
Hello everyone. WElcome to my project. 
It is a simple application that can continuously give you users current location like Uber. 
It can fetch you nearby locations like you can get the nearby hopitalsm school, gymnesyamns etc.
You can get the shortes route like Uber do, if you want to go to any location.
I you want to search for any location, It will suggest you your expected location like Google Map do.
Thank you so much guys.
